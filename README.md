# Receipt Generator for Masjid Donations

I developed a custom **Receipt Generator** application for my masjid to solve a common issue: **difficulty in generating and sharing digital donation receipts**. Previously, the masjid staff relied on manual, paper-based receipts or struggled with sharing receipts digitally in a professional format. This often led to delays, disorganization, and inconvenience for both the masjid and donors.

To address this, I built a simple but powerful tool that generates professional **PDF receipts** instantly, making it easy to **print or share via email, WhatsApp, or other digital platforms**.
